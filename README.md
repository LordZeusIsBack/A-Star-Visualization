# A* Path Finding Algorithm Visualization

This project is a visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm using Pygame. The algorithm uses Euclidean distance as the heuristic to find the shortest path between a start and an end point on a grid, while navigating around barriers.

## Features

- Visual representation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.
- Adjustable grid size.
- Ability to place start and end points.
- Ability to place barriers.
- Visualization of the pathfinding process.
- Reset and clear the grid for new searches.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LordZeusIsBack/astar-pathfinding-visualization.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd astar-pathfinding-visualization
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python astar_visualization.py
    ```

## How to Use

- **Left Click**:
  - Place the start point (orange).
  - Place the end point (turquoise).
  - Place barriers (black).

- **Right Click**:
  - Remove the start point.
  - Remove the end point.
  - Remove barriers.

- **Space Key**: Start the pathfinding algorithm.

- **C Key**: Clear the grid.
